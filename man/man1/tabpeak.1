.TH TABPEAK 1NEMO "25 March 2022"
.SH "NAME"
tabpeak \- find peaks or valleys in a table

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBtabpeak\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Find local maxima (and/or minima) and fit a local paraboloid, return the location and
value of the peak, or valley. See also \fItablsqfit(1NEMO)\fP and \fIccdmom(1NEMO)\fP.
.PP
The default is to search for local 3 point extrema. Using \fBedge=\fP one can force it
away from the edge, and using \fBpmin=\fP one can increase the minimum number of points
that need to be in the extreme

\fBycol=\fP

.TP
\fBclip=\fP
Only consider points above this [0]
.TP
\fBpmin=\fP
[EXPERIMENTAL]
Require the peak to contain at least \fBpmin\fP points. By default, only 3 are required, in which
case a polynomial is fit (though this is an exact fit).  By setting this higher, more points are
required to be part of a peak which is then required to be monotonously decreasing.
\fBedge=\fP
Number of points near the edge to skip for a peak finder.   For the simplest 3-point peak
finder this should be at least 1.

.TP
\fBvalley=t|f\fP
Also fit valleys, in which case the signal has to be below -clip. [Default: f]
.TP
\fBmean=t|f\fP
.TP
\fBnmax=\fP
max size if a pipe [100000]
