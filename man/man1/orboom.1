.TH ORBOOM 1NEMO "27 Dec 2019"
.SH NAME
orboom \- Transform an orbit and ODM into 'BOOM' HDF [still testing]
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBorboom\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is under development for the BOOM project. It will take
some combination input of a simulation (series of snapshots),
orbit(s) and ODM's  [to be determined] and turn them into a BOOM hdf
for further analysis outside of NEMO.  
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input snapshot simulation. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output BOOM file. Currently NEMO  
.TP
\fBndim=\fP
2 or 3 dimensional. Not implemented. [3]
.TP
\fBmode=2|3\fP
2 or 3 dimensional. Not implemented. [3]
.TP
\fBsize=\fP
Half the size of the ODM box, meaning the X, Y and Z coordinates
are gridded from -size:size. This also implies we only compute
square cubes [2].
.TP
\fBnpix=\fP
Number of pixels along any of the X, Y or Z axes. The same pixels
in all dimensions. [32]
.TP
\fBtimes=\fP
What times to select. Currently all. The code is limited to 10,000.
.TP
\fBnsteps=\fP
If not given, the input file will be scanned first. Not implemented yet.
.TP
\fBbody=\fP
If set, only this body will be output. This is useful for debugging.
.TP
\fBhdf=f|t\fP
Output file format in HDF ?  If not, NEMO format will be used.
Currently only NEMO format is supported. [f]
.SH EXAMPLES
The current version just writes NEMO Orbit/Image file.  To extract
a certain orbit or image, here is an example
.nf
   #   create a BOOM file
   mkplummer p100 100 seed=100
   gyrfalcON  p100 p100.out step=0.1 tstop=10 eps=0.025 kmax=8 give=mxvap
   orboom p100.out p100.boom

   #   look at an orbit, an ODM, and a projected ODM along the Z axis
   csf p100.boom - Orbit 11 | orbplot -
   csf p100.boom - Image 11 | ccdfits - p100_10.fits
   csf p100.boom - Image 11 | ccdmom - - | ccdfits - p100_10_mom0.fits
   
.fi
Of course there two other ways to select that same orbit (11th one in this example)
from a simulation, but both methods need a patch for more efficiency:
.nf

   stoo p100.out - ibody=10 | tsf -     [this one is currently broken]q
   snapcopy p100.out - select=i==10 ibody=10 | snapmerge - - | snapplot -
   
.fi
The latter one is useful to view a 3D orbit with
\fIsnapplot3(1NEMO)\fP or \fIglnemo2(1NEMO)\fP
