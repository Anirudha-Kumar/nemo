.TH MKDISKFEL 1NEMO "31 December 2019"
.SH NAME
mkdisk \- set up a test disk in a spherical potential filling f(E,Lz)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkdiskfel out=\fPsnapshot [parameters=values ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fImkdiskfel\fP sets up a disk of test particles launched from a specific
axis (\fBx\fP or \fBy\fP)
in the gravitational potential of a user-supplied potential (in
\fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP format), in order to get a reasonable sample
of all possible orbits in the allowed phase space of bound orbits.
The initial condition will thus look very boring,
and after an integration with programs such as  \fIpotcode(1NEMO)\fP
and further analysis things will make more sense.
.PP
For testing there is an option to only populate particles on the 
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword is also
given:
.TP 25
\fBout=\fIout_file\fP
The data are written to this file in \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP 
format . Currently the potential and total energy are stored in the
Potential and Aux slots of the snapshot. [no default].
.TP
\fBnbody=\fInum_bodies\fP
Number of bodies particles [default: \fB2048\fP]
.TP
\fBpotname=\fIpotential_name\fP
name of the \fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP.
[no default].
.TP
\fBpotpars=\fIpot_pars\fP
Paramaters to the user supplied potential. The number of parameters
depends on the potential supplied, the first parameter is reserved
for the pattern speed.
[default: not supplied, parameters as defined by potential(5)].
.TP
\fBpotfile=\fIpot_data\fP
Optional data file(s) to the user supplied potential. 
The number of files depends
on the potential supplied.
[default: not supplied, or datafile(s) defined by potential(5)].
.TP
\fBrmin=\fImin_disk_radius\fP
Inner cutoff radius of test-particle disk. [Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBrmax=\fImax_disk_radius\fP
Outer cutoff radius of test-particle disk. [Default: \fB2\fP].
.TP
\fBmass=\fItot_mass\fP
Total mass of the disk. The default total mass is 0, since this is a
testdisk. Since there are a few programs that will not like mass-less
particles, this keyword can be used, or \fIsnapmass\fP
will have to be used before further action is taken.
[default: \fB0\fP].
\fBseed=\fIrandom_seed\fP
Use random number seed. If 0 is given, a random number is generated
from the time of the day. [default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBsign=-1|1\fP
Sign of the angular momentum. 1 means counter clockwise rotation in the
XY-plane (in case you were wondering, 
our galaxy has sign=-1). [Default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBlaunch=x|y\fP
Launch axis. Since all orbits are in the X-Y plane, the options here
are \fBx\fP or \fBy\fP.
.TP
\fBmaxlz=t|f\fP
Try and find only the maxlz orbits per energy/radius. 
.TP
\fBheadline=\fImessage\fP
Text headline for output file [default: not used].
.SH EXAMPLES
An Y-VX phase plot (the only non-zero coordinate in the initial conditions for launch=y) can be created
as follows for the circular orbits and the full "f(E,L)" type:
.nf

  mkdiskfel - maxlz=t | snapplot - xvar=y yvar=-vx xrange=0:2 yrange=0:1.6 yapp=1/xs
  mkdiskfel -         | snapplot - xvar=y yvar=-vx xrange=0:2 yrange=0:1.6 yapp=2/xs
  mkdiskfel -         | snapplot - xvar=etot yvar='-y*vx' xrange=-1:0.2 yrange=0:1 yapp=3/xs

.fi

the last example represents the true f(E,Lz) sampling.
