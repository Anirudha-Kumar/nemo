.TH CCDSUB 1NEMO "17 June 2003"
.SH NAME
ccdsub \- sub/average of an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdsub\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdsub\fP takes a subimage from an image, as described by a new
set of coordinates in X, Y and/or Z (since the expression of the
selected axes is arbitrary, the resulting coordinate system may
be bogus).
.PP
Since cubes/images produced by this program may have dummy
axes (length 1), you will need to use \fIccdslice(1NEMO)\fP to
get rid of them.
