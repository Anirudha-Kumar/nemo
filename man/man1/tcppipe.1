.TH TCPPIPE 1NEMO "2 July 2001"
.SH NAME
tcppipe \- create TCP connection to send data from/to pipe
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtcppipe\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
TCPpipe is a very small program to transfer any kind of data from one
host to another over a network.
To do this, first TCPpipe on one host must listen, then TCPpipe on the
other host can connect. After this the data can be transfered: The
sending TCPpipe reads from standard-input and sends it to the receiving
TCPpipe, which writes to standard-output. This allows to connect two
processes on different machines.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBhost=\fP
hostname, only needed in send mode [] 
.TP 20
\fBport=\fP
TCP/IP port to communicate with [2801]  
.TP 20
\fBbufsize=\fP
buffersize to use [1024]    
.TP 20
.SH EXAMPLES
On machine A you start by piping data into tcppipe:
.nf
    A% mkplummer - 1000 | tcppipe
.fi
after which on machine B you tell it to expect data from machine A and send it to the next 
task in the pipe:
.nf
    B% tcppipe A | tsf -
.fi
.SH CAVEATS
A TCP/IP connnection that was used, will remain blocked for usage on that same port
for a little while (usually 60 seconds).
Equally so, tcppipe will only listen for so long until it gives
up, it will not block that port forever (????)
