.TH YANCNEMO 1NEMO "29 May 2001"
.SH NAME
YancNemo \- Yet Another N-body Code (NEMO version)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBYancNemo\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBYancNemo\fP is Dehnen's version of the 
tree code, where the approximate evaluation of gravitational forces is
extended and substantially accelerated by including mutual cell-cell
interactions. These are computed by a Taylor series in Cartesian coordinates
and in a completely symmetric fashion, such that Newton's third law is now
satisfied by construction and hence momentum exactly conserved. The
computational effort is further reduced by exploiting the mutual symmetry of
the interactions. For typical astrophysical problems with N=10^5 and at the
same level of accuracy, the new code is about four times faster than the tree
code. For large N, the computational costs are found to scale almost linearly
with N, which can also be supported by a theoretical argument, and the
advantage over the tree code increases with ever larger N.
.PP
\fBYancNemo\fP is the NEMOfied version, the barebone version is named YANC.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input file, needs to be in \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP format. [???]
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output file, will be in \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP format. [???]     
.TP
\fBtstop=\fP
Time at which integration is stopped. Also called \fBtcrit\fP in
Aarseth's nbody* series. [10]     
.TP
\fBstep=\fP
Output integration step. Some other codes use 1/freqout, or \fBdeltat\fP for this
 [1]    
.TP
\fBtheta=\fP
Opening angle parameter at M=M_root [0.5]   
.TP
\fBeps=\fP
Softening length [0.05]     
.TP
\fBkernel=\fP
Type of softening kernel. This is an integer, with n/(10+n)/20/21
for Fn/Kn/Plummer/Improved, and will likely add more kernels in the
future. [21]
.TP
\fBhmin=\fP
Timestep indicator such that tau_min = (1/2)^hmin. [Default: 6] 
.TP
\fBgive_pot=\fP
Output potentials? Valid values are 0/1, which output none or all
potentials. 
Potentials are returned in the usual \fBPotential\fP slot of a \fISnapShot(5NEMO)\fP.
[0]    
.TP
\fBgive_rho=\fP
Output densities? Valid values are 0/1/2, which output none/density/surface density.
Densities are returned in the \fBAux\fP slot of a \fISnapShot(5NEMO)\fP.
[Default: 0].
.TP
\fBNlev=\fP
# time-step levels [1]    
.TP
\fBNref=\fP
# bodies in cell for density estimate [16]
.TP
\fBfac=\fP
factor in tau < fac / rho. Only used if Nlev > 1. []
.SH MEMORY USAGE
For a 128k run, memory usage is about 27MB. This will scale roughly
linearly for larger systems.
