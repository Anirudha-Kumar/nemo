.TH HACKDENS 1NEMO "12 August 2022"

.SH "NAME"
hackdens \- local density estimator using tree algorithm

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBhackdens in=\fPsnapshot \fBout=\fPimage [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIhackdens\fP calculates the local density in the configuration space
using the hierarchical
N-body algorithm (J. Barnes and P. Hut, \fINature\fP \fB324\fP, 446).
For small N or systems with complex geometry \fBsnapdens(1NEMO)\fP may
be preferred. For even more performance, \fBdensity(1falcON)\fP can be
used.
.PP
The density can be writtin in the slot normally used for Potentials (the default),
or if \fBwrite_at_phi=f\fP be written to a tag named \fIDensity\fP.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.so man1/parameters
.TP 24
\fBin\fP=\fIin-file\fP
Input data will be read from \fIin-file\fP in
snapshot format.
.TP
\fBout\fP=\fIout-file\fP
Output data are written to \fIout-file\fP in snapshot format.
.TP
\fBneib\fP=\fIvalue\fP
Number of neighbors used to determine the local density. The default
of 6 is the recommended value by Casertano & Hut (1985)
[default: 6].

.TP
\fBrneib\fP=\fIvalue\fP
Initial radius to search the neighbors. \fIHackdens\fP adaptively
change this search radius during the calculation. Therefore it is
definitely required that particles in the snapshot are arranged so
that the neighboring particles have similar local density. (See NOTES)
[default: 0.1].
.TP
\fBwrite_at_phi\fP=\fIt|f\fP
Logical if the density data is written in the "Potential" slot of the
snapshot file. If false, the density will be written with tag "Density".
[default: f]
.TP
\fBrsize\fP=\fIvalue\fP
Intial size of the root box. Box will automatically expanded to keep
all particles in it [defaults:4.0]
.TP
\fBrmin\fP=\fIvalue\fP
If given, the coordinates of the lower left corner of the initial box.
If not given, the center of the root box will lie at the origin.
[defaults:none]
.TP
\fBoptions\fP=\fIoption-string\fP
Output control options, specified as a comma-separated list
of keywords.
Currently recognized keywords are:
\fBmass\fP, \fBphase\fP: output mass, phase space
data with major data outputs [defaults:mass,phase].
.TP
\fBfcells\fP=\fIvalue\fP
Ratio of cells to bodies, used  when
allocating cells [defaults:0.9].
.TP
\fBnudge\fP=\fIsize\fP

.TP
\fBverbose\fP=\fIt|f\fP
Logical if print out the number of particles processed during the
calculation [defaults:f].

.SH "NOTES"
Since the search radius is adaptively changed during the calculation,
the local density of particles which are close in the position in the
snapshot file should be similar.
.PP
Ideally, it is best if particles are
sorted by the local density itself. Since the local density is not
available, the second choice is to sort particles with some quantity
that has strong correlation with the local density. For example, if
the potential is available, sort particles by
potential.
.PP
In many cases the system is roughly spherically symmetric.
That means the density has strong correlation with the distance from
the center of the cluster. Then sorting particles by the distance from
the center will improve the speed significantly.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following example takes an N-body snapshot, sort the particles
in the order of the distance from the C.M., and calculate local density.
.nf

   snapcenter nbody.dat nbody.centered
   snapsort nbody.centered nbody.sorted rank="x*x+y*y+z*z"
   hackdens nbody.sorted nbody.density

.fi
One can also weight the particles by its potential to some power. For this we create a Plummer sphere, without
centering, and compute the center in two ways:
.nf
   mkplummer - 100 zerocm=f | snapsort - - rank=r > p.dat
   snapcenter p.dat . report=t
   hackdens p.dat - | snapcenter  - . weight=dens report=t
   hackforce p.dat - | snapcenter - . weight="-phi*phi*phi" report=t
   hackforce p.dat - | snapcenter - . weight="phi*phi*phi*phi" report=t
   
.fi
Note that in this case the Plummer sphere should have the correct mathematical center, and not \fIcentered\fP.
This snippet of code is expanded in a script $NEMO/scripts/csh/centering.sh, in which these different methods
can also be applied to different models, as expanded in the following table.
.nf

    nbody=100 models:     Plummer   King1   King3   King5  DeVauc
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    snapcenter  on m:       0.102   0.029*  0.030*  0.033   0.299
    snapcenter  on dens:    0.060   0.039   0.036   0.030   0.030*
    snapcenter  on phi^3:   0.052*  0.032   0.030   0.026*  0.035
    snapcenter  on phi^4:   0.054   0.034   0.032   0.027   0.031
    snapcenterp:            0.080

.fi
Although for a Plummer sphere one method is about twice as better than the worst method,
this does not apply to other models, plus the phi^3 weighting is not always best.

.SH "BUGS"
The local density is calculated using (neib-1)th neighbor.
Calculation can become very slow if the input snapshot is not
well-formed. There should exist an option that forces the density will be
written in the "Aux" slot of the snapshot file. Current version does
not use standard \fIget_snap/put_snap\fP macros. KEY and AUX will be lost from
the output snapshot. 

.SH "TIMING"

the center of mass of the system.
