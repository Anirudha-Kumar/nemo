.TH GYRFALCON 1NEMO "5 April 2004"
.SH NAME
gyrfalcON \- GalaxY simulatoR using falcON (NEMO version)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgyrfalcON\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgyrfalcON\fP (formerly called YancNemo) is a 
NEMO adaptation of Walter Dehnen's version of the 
tree code, where the approximate evaluation of gravitational forces is
extended and substantially accelerated by including mutual cell-cell
interactions. These are computed by a Taylor series in Cartesian coordinates
and in a completely symmetric fashion, such that Newton's third law is now
satisfied by construction and hence momentum exactly conserved. The
computational effort is further reduced by exploiting the mutual symmetry of
the interactions. For typical astrophysical problems with N=10^5 and at the
same level of accuracy, the new code is about four times faster than the tree
code. For large N, the computational costs are found to scale almost linearly
with N, which can also be supported by a theoretical argument, and the
advantage over the tree code increases with ever larger N.
.PP
The (NEMO) programs \fIaddgravity\fP and  \fIgetgravity\fP can be used
to obtain \fIfalcON\fP forces without the need of going through the integrator.
.PP
For a detailed description of usage, see also the \fIUser Guide for falcON\fP.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input file, needs to be in \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP format. 
[No default]
.TP

Time at which integration is stopped. Also called \fBtcrit\fP in
Aarseth's nbody* series. [10]

file for log output (default: stderr). Formerly called logout=

hold before it is considered for further sub-division in the tree building
stage of the code. [6]

Newtonion (with a warning message).

.TP
\fBNlev=\fP
Number of time step levels [1].
.TP
\fBfac=\fP
tau = fac/acc. If more than one of \fBfac=\fP, \fBfph=\fP or 
\fBfpa=\fP is non-zero, we use the minimum tau.
.TP
\fBfph=\fP
tau = fph/pot
.TP
\fBfpa=\fP
tau = fpa*sqrt(pot)/acc
.TP
\fBresume=\fP
resume old simulation?  that implies:
1) read last snapshot from input file
2) append to input file (unless out given)          
[f].
.TP
\fBgive=\fP
List of output specifications. Recognizing
m (mass), x (position), v (velocity), a (acceleration), p (N-body potential),
P (external potential, deprecated), r (density estimate, deprecated). 
l (time-step level, if they exist), f (body flag).
[Default: mxv]
.TP
\fBgive2=\fP
list of specifications for secondary output.
[Default: mxv]
.TP
\fBGrav=\fP
Value of the gravitational constant [1].
.TP
\fBpotname=\fP
Name of external potential. See also \fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP.
.TP
\fBpotpars=\fP
Parameters of external potential, if required.
.TP
\fBpotfile=\fP
Filename, if required by external potential.
.TP
\fBstartout=t|f\fP
give snapshot for t=tstart? [t]
.SH RESOURCES
For a 128k run, memory usage is about 18MB (was: 27MB?). This will scale roughly
linearly for larger systems. The following little benchmark 
.nf
	mkplummer - $N | gyrfalcON - . tstop=1
.fi
Will take about 78" for N=100,000 on a 2GHz Pentium-iv. It
scales slightly better than linear, for N=1,000,000 it takes
about 728".
.SH EXAMPLES
The benchmark in the Users Guide is a 10^5 Plummer sphere (default) integration:

.SH OUTPUT DATA WARNING
\fBgyrfalcON\fP, much like ZENO programs, writes a new type of SnapShot files,
in which the \fIPhaseSpace\fP array has been split into a
\fIPosition\fP and \fIVelocity\fP array. The \fIget_snap\fP macros 
understand this flavor, but will - for now - convert the data back
into the less flexible type with combined \fIPhaseSpace\fP coordinates.
