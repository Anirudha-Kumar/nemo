.TH HDFGRID 1NEMO "17 December 2004"
.SH NAME
hdfwedge \- Regrid a polar HDF4 SDS wedge to cartesian image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhdfwedge\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhdfwedge\fP regrids HDF (SDS) output files that are assumed to
be in polar (rad-phi) coordinates, but can contain any size wedge
(ideally an integer fraction of 2.PI). It was cloned off
\fPhdfgrid(1NEMO)\fP in December 2004, so a number of their 
comments on the assumptions on the input format also apply to
this program.
.PP
The first two dimension must be radius and angle, there can be
an optional 3rd dimension, but it must be 1 slice in Z only.
.PP
The (2D) four-point interpolation that is used in regridding is
based on the one in \fIcmhog/movie.src\fP, but includes correct
interpolations for points that are created if \fBperiodic=t\fP
is used. The program is not well designed to detect errors
in the amount of periodicity (e.g. creating a wedge
from -1 to 1 radian, and setting \fPperiodic=t\fP will probably
result in awkward looking images.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP\fIhdf_sds\fP
Input file (HDF SD). No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP\fIimage\fP
Output file, in \fIimage(5NEMO)\fP format.
.TP
\fBselect=\fP\fIframe_no\fP
Select which SDS from the file (1=first). See also \fBzvar=\fP below.
[Default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBnx=\fP\fIX_pixels\fP
Number of pixels in X.
[Default: \fB256\fP]
.TP
\fBny=\fP\fIY_pixels\fP
Number of pixels in Y   
[Default: \fB256\fP].
.TP
\fBxrange=\fP\fIxmin:xmax\fP
Range in X     
[Default: \fB-16:16\fP].
.TP
\fByrange=\fP\fIymin:ymax\fP
Range in Y     
[Default: \fB-16:16\fP].
.TP
\fBzvar=\fP\fIgrid_var\fP
Gridding variable. Normally left alone, unless certain allowed mathematical
expressions on the direct griddable variables (as defined by \fBselect=\fP)
need to be overriden. Allowed are \fBvr\fP (select=1), \fBvt\fP (select=2),
\fBden\fP (select=3), \fBvx\fP, \fBvy\fP, 
\fBvm\fP and \fBvp\fP. Note
that \fBvm\fP and \fBvp\fP are special cases of
a linear combination of \fBvx\fP, \fBvy\fP
\fIvm =  (vx-vy)/sqrt(2)\fP and \fIvp = (vx+vy)/sqrt(2)\fP, just
to get an idea of the velocity field under a "middle" position angle.
Default: not used, select= is used.
.TP
\fBperiodic=t|f\P
Attempt to fill the plane by making the data periodic.
[Default: \fBt\fP].
.TP
\fBsymmetry=odd|even|automatic\fP
Override symmetry properties of the variable to be gridded. 
This option is not used yet. See also \fBmirror=\fP
