.TH POTROT 1NEMO "07 February 2005"
.SH NAME
potrot \- query a NEMO potential in the XY plane, and derive a rotation curve 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpotrot\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpotrot\fP computed the "rotation curve" (as defined by
\fIsqrt(radius*radial_force)\fP) of a potential. Single slit
rotation curves can be defined (by using a single given 
angle \fBp=\fP) as well as averaged along a set of position
angles (e.g. \fBp=0:90:2\fP).
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBpotname=\fP
Name of potential [???]    
.TP
\fBpotpars=\fP
Parameters for potential (1st one is pattern speed)
.TP
\fBpotfile=\fP
Any optional data file associated with potential []
.TP
\fBr=\fP
Radii to sample. Notice for most potentials r=0 results in NaN's or 
divisions by zero and generally bad output.  [0:2:0.1]    
.TP
\fBp=\fP
Angles to sample (degrees) [0]   
.TP
\fBt=\fP
Time to test potential at, if relevant [0.0]
.TP
\fBomega=\fP
Use this instead of any returned pattern speed
.TP
\fBformat=\fP
Format used to print numbers [%g]  
**not used yet**
.TP
\fBniter=\fP
Iteration max [10]     
**not used yet**
.TP
\fBeps=\fP
Accuracy [0.001]

.SH EXAMPLES

Here is an example of taking a "rotation curve" along the major, minor and force average
of a Pfenniger(1984) bar. The three tables are then cut into a simpler form
and plotted using tabplot. With the default pgplot interface for 
\fIyapp\fP they are colored rsp. red, green and blue.
