.TH POTROT 1NEMO "07 February 2005"
.SH NAME
potrot \- query a NEMO potential in the XY plane, and derive a rotation curve 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpotrot\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
  I've tried out the alternative approach to get a rotation curve from  
a potential. I might move this over into the potq program, but for now
it's implemented in potrot (it should have a manual page by the time
you read this). Basically it uses the grid to derive a radial force,
which can be averaged over a number of angles (but e.g. by using p=0
or p=90 you can get a major or minor axis ration curve),from whidhc then
the averages rotation curve is derived   v=sqrt(<force>*r)
Looks nice and smooth for N4303 which i tried, as attached. I've done
this:

.SH EXAMPLES

Here is an example of taking a "rotation curve" along the major, minor and force average
of a Pfenniger(1984) bar. The three tables are then cut into a simpler form
and plotted using tabplot. With the default pgplot interface for 
\fIyapp\fP they are colored rsp. red, green and blue.
