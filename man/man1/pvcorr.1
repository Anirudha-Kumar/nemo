.TH PVCORR 1NEMO "29 May 2013"
.SH NAME
pvcorr \- PV correlation search
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpvcorr\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using a template area in a PV diagram, this template is shifted in the
V direction and a cross correlation is computed. Normally a strong
well known line will be selected, which has a known restfrequency,
from which the other lines can be identified. See also \fItabpeak(1NEMO)\fP
to find the peaks in the output from this program.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file - must be an PV diagram, with V along the Y-axis. No default.
.TP
\fBclip=\fP
Clip value to search for valid profiles in the template area defined between
rows \fBy0\fP and \fBy1\fP (inclusive).
.TP
\fBy0=\fP
First row to search for template. [0]
.TP
\fBy1=\fP
Last row to search for template. [30]
.TP
\fBregion=\fP
MIRIAD style region definition of the template area. Not implemented yet,
but expect something like region=polygon(10,10,40,15,40,25,10,20)
.TP
\fByscale=\fP
Scale the velocity pixel value by this number to get more presentable
numbers in the output. Astronomical data sometimes appear in Hz or m/s.
[Default: 1]
.SH EXAMPLES
First an uncalibrated (in velocity) pv1.tab is produced, this needs to be inspected 
where the strongest template line is located. The velocity axis can then be recomputed
such that the template line as the correct value, and all the others fall in place:
.nf

pvcorr pv1 0.01 0 30 1e-9 > pv1.tab
# y0min=6 y1max=20
# inspect where the tabpeak cutoff should be, 0.01 seems ok to get all and a bit more
tabpeak pv1.tab clip=0.01 > pv1.peak
# the reference line was fitted at -0.000066 (strongest line in pv1.peak) but has freq 100.07640 GHz

.SH CAVEATS
The current template is defined via the parameters \fB(clip,y0,y1)\fP and is far from ideal. Ideally a properly smoothed
version of a PV diagram will contain a better definition of the template.
.PP
A XYV cube version should work even better.
.PP
Instead of the derived template shape, one could also define the offset by using a first moment.
