.TH EPIC5 1NEMO "20 April 2021"
.SH NAME
epic5 \-  lindblad orbits in ovally perturbed potentials

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBepic5\fP
.PP
\fBepibin\fP

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBepic5\fP computes positions, velocities and densities along closed
orbits of interstellar matter, including frictional forces, in a galaxy 
with an arbitrary perturbing potential. Radial velocities are given for 
chosen lines of sight.

The direction of rotation is defined according to the sign of the
pattern speed (positive: counter clock wise rotation, negative: clock
wise rotation).


.PP
For theory and description see Per A.B. Lindblad, thesis Stockholm 
Observatory 1996, Chapt. 2.2 and Paper V (Lindblad & Lindblad 1994, 
ASPC 66, p.29), and the "EPIC5 manual".
.PP
\fBepibin\fP ... bins the LOS velocities from EPIRV. Cannot contain
more than 200 points at the moment. (not compiling yet)

.SH "RUNNING"
Running \fBepic5\fP is very different from running a NEMO program. All input
has to be given interactively on the commandline, and at a number of places
you can re-run an option and stay within the program "forever".
The first question will be the name of the input
parameter file. An example, \fBepar\fP is supplied with
the package. Three output files (EPIRV, EPIDEN, EPITEST) need to be present
so the program can write on top.
.PP
\fBParameter file:\fP
Input parameters must be given in a parameter file with the following
content (file names are a string with max 10 characters):
.nf

    Name of file with rotation curve                    ('VFILE')
    Name of file with perturbing potential              ('BFILE')
    Pattern velocity in km/s/kpc                        (OMEGAP)
    Coefficient of friction at 0 kpc                    (BLAMBD0)
    Coefficient of friction at RMAX kpc                 (BLAMBDf)
    Soft corotation coefficient in km/s/kpc             (EOMEG)
    Minimum value for R in the computations in kpc      (R0)
    Interval of R in the computations in kpc            (DR)
    Maximum value for R in the computations in kpc      (RMAX)
    Number of THETA values (<60) for each R             (NTHETA)
.fi

The rotation curve and the perturbing potential are both ascii files:
.PP
'VFILE' must have the following format:
.nf
    NFRAD DRFRAD
    FRAD(I), (I=1,NFRAD)
.fi

where NFRAD (<NRAD) is the number of velocities and DRFRAD is the
radial increment between velocities in the rotation curve, and FRAD the 
velocities. The first point, I=1, corresponds to a radius R = 0.
.PP
'BFILE' must have the following format:
.nf
    NPER DRP MMAX NTH NC
    AMPC(M), (M=1,10) 
    AMPS(M), (M=1,10)
    for M=1,MMAX:
       CP(I,M) (I=1,NPER)
       SP(I,M) (I=1,NPER)
.fi
.PP
where NPER (<NRAD) is the number of values and DRP the increment 
between values for the perturbing potential. CP(I,M) and SP(I,M)  
are amplitudes of the COS(M*THETA) resp. SIN(M*THETA) components of 
of the Fourier development the perturbing potential. AMPC(M) and 
AMPS(M) are factors with which these amplitudes will be multiplied. 
MMAX (<10) is the maximum M value in the development of the potential. 
NTH (<100) and NC are the number of THETA values and contours for 
potential plotting.
.PP
Positions and densities will be listed in file \fBEPIDEN\fP
and plotted in file \fBdensity.ps\fP.
Positions, x and y velocities will be listed in file \fBEPIRV\fP
and plotted in file \fBvelocity.ps\fP
.PP
Test values are written in file \fBEPITEST\fP.

There is a unix IRC client with the same name, see \fIepic5(1)\fP. But we were here first, so there.
