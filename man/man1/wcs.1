.TH WCS 1NEMO "2 March 2003"
.SH NAME
wcs \- coordinate transforms 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwcs\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwcs\fP is really a wrapper for AIPS worldpos/xypix WCS routines
(\fIworldpos(3NEMO)\fP), much like the \fItestpos.c\fP routine that
is publicly available, but with a more typical NEMO 
command line user interface.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBref=\fP
The reference coordinates (deg) at the reference pixel. Two numbers
are required. 
These will typically be the equivalent of the \fBcrval\fP in \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP.
.TP
\fBrefpix=\fP
The reference pixels (pixels). They can be floating point numbers and
do not have to be on or inside a 'grid'. Two numbers are required.
These will typically be the equivalent of the \fBcrpix\fP in \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP.
.TP
\fBinc=\fP
Increment at the reference pixel.
These will typically be the equivalent of the \fBcdelt\fP in \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP.
.TP
\fBrot=\fP
Rotation angle (deg) (from N through E) at the reference pixel
These will typically be the equivalent of the \fBcrota\fP in \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP..
.TP
\fBtype=\fP
Projection type (SIN, TAN, ARC, NCP, GLS, MER, AIT).
These will typically the last 4 characters in the \fBctype\fP in \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP.
.TP
\fBformat=\fP
Output \fIprintf(3)\fP-style format. [Default: %g].
.TP
\fBpix=\fP
Input Pixel number coordinates. Either one of \fBpix=\fP
or \fBpos=\fP must be given, if this one is given, conversion
to world coordinates is done. Note that pixels are 1-based in FITS,
and 0-based in NEMO.
.TP
\fBpos=\fP
Input World Coordinates. If this one is given, conversion
to pixel coordinates is done.
