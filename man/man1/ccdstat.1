.TH CCDSTAT 1NEMO "14 November 2004"
.SH NAME
ccdstat \- statistics (1st through 4th moment)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBccdstat in=\fPimage [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will calculate all moments (up to fourt order) of the mapvalues,
and calculate some human understandable numbers (mean, dispersion, skewness,
curtosis) from them. It can optionally use a weighting map, in case the 
map needs to weighted per pixel.
.PP
If the map contains an error normalized difference between an
observation and model, it can also compute the chi2 if the number of 
of fitting parameters (\fBnpar\fP, must be > 0 to trigger this option)
is given, as well as the number of independant points per beam (\fBnppb\fP).
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword is also
given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fIin-file\fP
input file, in \fIImage(5)\fP format [no default]
.TP
\fBmin=\fImin_value\fP
If given, all values below this value are ignored in the statistics. 
By default no lower limit is used.
.TP
\fPmax=\fImax_value\fP
If given, all values above this value are ignored in the statistics.
By default no upper limit is used.
.TP
\fBbad=\fIbad_value\fP
If given, all values identical to this value are ignored in the statistics.
Note that, apart for bad=0, it is dangerous to use equating to a real value
as a masking operating.
.TP
\fBwin=\fIweight-file\fP
optional input file, in \fIImage(5)\fP format, of which the mapvalues
are used as a relative weight factor. Should be all positive, with 0
meaning no weight.
[no default]
.TP
\fBnpar=\fP
Number of fitting parameters. If given > 0, this will trigger the
computation of chi2 goodness of fit, instead of the normal statistics.
.TP
\fBnppb=\fP
Number of (independant) points per beam.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.nf
  % ccdstat image.ccd min=-2
Min=-1.879409  Max=2.265516
Number of points     : 95
Mean and dispersion  : 0.097891 0.956030
Skewness and kurtosis: -0.059936 -0.654776
5/100 out-of-range points discarded
.fi
Here is an example how to created a weight file which is a circular annulus:
.nf
  % ccdmath out=map1 "fie=iflt(%r,50,1,0)" size=200,200 crpix=100,100
  % ccdmath out=map2 "fie=iflt(%r,20,1,0)" size=200,200 crpix=100,100
  % ccdmath map1,map2 map3 %1-%2
.fi
Here is an two masking example: firstignoring the exact value of 0, 
followed by an example of a small range around 0:
.nf
  % ccdstat map1 bad=0
  % ccdmath map1 - 'iflt(abs(%1),0.001,0,%1)' | ccdstat - bad=0
