.TH TABBLEND 1NEMO "21 December 2011"
.SH NAME
tabblend \- create (blended) lines and grid them
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtabblend\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtabblend\fP creates a blended line spectrum, grids them,
optionally with hanning smoothing and outputs a table that
can be compared with observations, or be fitted with
\fItabnllsqfit(1NEMO)\fP.
.PP
After a raw spectrum is computed on the grid specified by \fBs=\fP,
it can be optionally smoothed using \fBfwhm=\fP, after which
it is currently simply gridded on the grid specified by
\fBg=\fP. Note that both grids need to be regular (use the notation
\fImin:max:step\fP) and \fBmin<max\fP. An optional simple (1/4,1/2,1/4)
hanning smoothing can be applied. As last step before output noise
can be added.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBx=\fP\fIx1,x2,...\fP
X coordinates (velocities if you wish) of the line(s). Multiple
velocities can be given here.
.TP 
\fBa=\fP\fIa1,a2,...\fP
Amplitudes for each line. 
If not enough values are given, the last value repeats.
[1]
.TP
\fBd=\fP\fId1,d2,...\fP
FWHM of the lines (FWHM=2.355*sigma) [1]  
.TP
\fBs=\fP\fImin:max:step\fP
Points where to sample. They need to be regular and increasing.
[Default: -16:16:0.01]    
.TP
\fBg=\fP\fImin:max:step\fP
Points where to lay the grid. They need to be regular and increasing.
[Default: -16:16:1]    
.TP
\fBfwhm=\fP
If non-zero, smooth points with this beam [0]
.TP
\fBhanning=t|f\fP
Optional hanning.
.TP
\fBfft=t|f\fP
Use FFT to compute observed spectrum? (not implemented,
probably another mode=)
.TP
\fBrms=\fP
RMS value for the noise added to the spectrum before printing.
This can be done to either raw (mode=0) or gridded (mode=1)
spectrum.
Default: 0
.TP
\fBseed=\fP
The usual random seed (see also \fIxrandom(1NEMO)\fP). Default: 0
.TP 
\fBmode=\fP
Output mode. 0 will output the raw spectrum before smoothing 
and gridding etc.   1=will output the final spectrum, after 
all gridding and noise addition. Default: 1
