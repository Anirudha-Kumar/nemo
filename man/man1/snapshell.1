.TH SNAPSHELL 1NEMO "17 November 2001"
.SH NAME
snapshell \- compute statistics of bodyvariables in a set of shells
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnapshell in=\fPsnap_file [parameter=value] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnapshell\fP computes various selected diagnostics and their statistics 
from the input
N-body snapshot in a set of shells. The snapshot must have been
properly centered and oriented using 
other tools (e.g. \fIsnapcenter(1NEMO)\fP and/or
\fIsnaprect(1NEMO)\fP). The analysis can be done in shell selected
in configuration space (if svar= is not selected), or in the
normalized space (0-1) of any body variable (if svar= is selected)
.PP
An arbitrary weighting may be specified for each particle.
.PP
The output will be an ascii table, in which for each variable it will
print a
selected set of statistics (mean, dispersion, min, max, skewness, kurtosis,
number of particles). Shells with no particles are not output.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized.
.TP 24
\fBin=\fP\fIsnap_file\fP
Input data is read from \fIsnap_file\fP, which must be in
\fIsnapshot\fP(5NEMO) format.  Note that only the first snapshot
found in this file will be used. Default: \fIrequired\fP.
.TP
\fBradii=\fP\fIr0,r1,r2,...\fP
A set of radii in \fInemoinp(3NEMO)\fP format, representing the
edges of the shell.
They need to be normalized to 1 when selected via \fBsvar=\fP.
.TP
\fBpvar=\fP\fIvariable\fP
The \fIbodytrans\fP(1NEMO) variable selected for statistics. 
[Default: \fBvt\fP].
.TP
\fBsvar=\fP\fIsort_variable\fP
If selected, this \fIbodytrans\fP(1NEMO)
variable will be used to sort the particles by, the
normalized radii (between 0 and 1) will then be used to define the shells
within which the diagnostics are computed. Default: not used.
.TP
\fBweight=\fP\fIbody_weight\fP
Expression used to compute the weight of each body.
See \fIbodytrans\fP(1NEMO) for the form of \fIbody_weight\fP.
Default: \fB1.0\fP.
.TP
\fBaxes=\fP\fIx,y,z\fP
Normalization values in X,Y and Z to compute (re-shape) radii. Only used
if shells are given in configuration space (i.e. svar= is not used) and
need to be ellipsoidal in shape. [Default: 1,1,1]
.TP
\fBstats=\fP\fIprint_stats\fP
Statistics selected to print. Allowed values are
\fBmean, dispersion, min, max, median, kurt, skew, n\fP. 
[Default: \fBmean,disp,n\fP].
.TP
\fBformat=\fIstring\fP
Valid C-format descriptor, as used in \fIprintf(3)\fP, for tabular output.
[default: \fB%g\fP].
.TP
\fBnormalized=t|f\fP
Should \fBsvar=\fP (if used) be done in normalized (0..1) space, and therefore
easily allow equal size bins, or in direct svar space (this requires knowledge
of the range of the \fBsvar\fP variable.
[Default: \fBt\fP]
.TP
\fBsort=t|f\fP
Should the snapshot be sorted? Normally true, and a basic shell sort is applied.
See \fIsnapsort(1NEMO)\fP if more advanced sorting is required.
[Default: \fBt\fP]

.SH EXAMPLES
To get a mean rotation speed in the disk, and the velocity dispersion, for a set of
rings:
.nf
    % \fBmkdisk - rmax=10 | snapsort - - r | snapshell - 0.01:10:0.1 pvar=vt\fP
    0.221025 0 1 : 0.213258 0
    0.347701 0.035125 2 : 0.318487 0.0270184
    0.468138 0.0260884 2 : 0.403087 0.0164231
    ...
    9.65953 0.0284596 39 : 0.319191 0.000455262
    9.7589 0.0288926 40 : 0.317613 0.00045552
    9.85975 0.0293125 41 : 0.316035 0.000455434
.fi
This results in rings with different numbers of particles (3rd column). By using
a sort variable (svar=), one can also divide the particle in equal numbers, and compute the
properties of the shells (which now have varying spatial width). The radii are now
normalized and must not exceed the interval 0-1:
.nf
    % \fBmkdisk - rmax=10 | snapsort - - r | snapshell - 0:1:0.01 svar=r\fP
.fi
In case the particles are sorted by potential from an N-body simulation, one can
select shells by particle number (easy way to make the binsizes the same)
.nf
    % \fBsnapsort run01.dat - phi times=4.0 | snapshell - 0:1:0.01 svar=phi\fP
.fi
or assign the shells directly in \fBsvar\fP space (this requires you to know the
values in svar space):
.nf
    % \fBsnapsort run01.dat - -phi times=4.0 | snapshell - -400:-200:10 svar=phi normalized=f\fP
.fi
.SH CAVEAT
Ellipsoidal shells may need reshape/sort/reshape?
.PP
Sorting should be done inside this program, not in the pipe?
