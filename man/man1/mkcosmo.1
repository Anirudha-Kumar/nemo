.TH MKCOSMO 1NEMO "1 November 2006"
.SH NAME
mkcosmo \- create a cosmology cube of equal massive stars
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkcosmo\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
From an input cube with density (or relative densities) on a regular grid,
initial conditions that correspond to the density variations at a given Z
(use Z=0 for non-comoving coordinates)
.PP
Note that this routine will only work in the linear regime when the fluctuations
are very small, resulting in small perturbations from the central location in
a cell.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input density (fluctuation) cube. 
No default
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output file name [???]    
.TP
\fBz=\fP
Size of cube [0.0]    
.TP
\fBabsrho=\fP
Is map absolute density or relative d(rho)/rho? [t]
