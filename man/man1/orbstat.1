.TH ORBSTAT 1NEMO "25 April 2005"
.SH NAME
orbstat \- tabulate some orbital statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBorbstat in=\fPorbit  [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBorbstat\fP will tabulate some statistical properties of a series
or orbits, as given in an input file. Currently time, energy (or first
integral of motion), the maximum extent in X, Y, VX and VY are given,
as well as the mean and dispersion in the angular momentum for 
(XY) planar orbits are given.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword is also
given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fIin-file\fP
Input file, which must be an \fIorbit(5NEMO)\fP. [No default].
.TP
\fBellipse=t|f\fP
Check how well the orbit is ellipsoidal.  If set to true, it
will print 
\fIT, E, r2_min, r2_max, v2_min, v2_max, r2_mean, r2_sigma, v2_mean, v2_sigma, Lmin/Lmax\fP.
Default: \fBf\fP.
.TP
\fBrelative=t|f\fP
Should energy statistics be done relative to the "known" value by subtracting it?
This is to improve the statistics if the integration is very accurate.
Default: \fBf\fP.
.TP
\fBtab=t|f\fP
Output a table with quantities
Default: \fBf\fP.
.SH CAVEAT
The \fBellipse=t\fP option only makes sense for closed orbits, since
the maximum extent in position and velocity is used for scaling factors
to check the ellipsoidability.
