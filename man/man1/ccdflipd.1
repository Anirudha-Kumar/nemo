.TH CCDFLIPD 1NEMO "14 March 2022"

.SH "NAME"
ccdflipd \- patch up neighbors that are +/- of each other within a delta

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBccdflipd\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This peculiar program patches an image where neighbors that sum to something close
to 0 (see \fBdelta=\fP below) become proper positive neighors. It will iterate over
the image until no more patches are needed.
.PP
In the current version each pixel looks at all 8 neighors and will flip the sign
of those neighbors if within range. In a future version a minimum number of those
8 neighbors might be required to avoid too flips.


.SH "PARAMETERS"
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file [???]    
.TP 
\fBout=\fP
Output image file [???]    
.TP 
\fBdelta=\fP
Allowed delta between sum of two neighboring pixels
[20]     
.TP 
\fBiter=\fP
Number of iterations [50]

.SH "EXAMPLES"
The origin of this peculiar program is a double peak fit (see \fIccdmom(1NEMO)\fP) to
a cube, where the two peaks are not always in the same order.   A difference map between
peak1 and peak2 will then have alternating signs, and this program nicely patches this up
