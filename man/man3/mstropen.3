.TH MSTROPEN 3NEMO "23 May 2002"
.SH NAME
mstr_init, mstr_open, mstr_close \- multiple template based file-stream utilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdinc.h>
.PP
.B mstr *mstr_init(string template)
.B stream mstr_open(mstr *mp, string mode)
.B void mstr_close(mstr *mp)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fImstr_init()\fP returns a structure that is used
to aid in writing to a set of related files
whose name is derived from a template and embedded integer counter.
The argument is a string which can optionally contain a template
in the form of a 
\fIprintf(3)\fP style string in which an integer is used to derive
a variable name, e.g. \fBrun%03d.dat\fP. This call will also open the
first (or only, if no template is used) 
file for writing. \fImstr_open\fP will however have 
to be used to get a \fIstream\fP in order to write actual data
(see example below).
.PP
\fImstr_open()\fP returns the \fIstream\fP (see \fIstropen(3NEMO)\fP)
to the next file.  It also closes the previously opened stream, if
there was such one.
.PP
\fImstr_close()\fP closes access to an \fBmstr\fP and free's all
allocated memory associated with it.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
	mstr *mp = mstr_init("test%03d.dat");
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
	   stream ostr = mstr_open(mp,"w");
	   fprintf(mp,"Hello world, i=%d\\n",i);
	}
	mstr_close(mp);
