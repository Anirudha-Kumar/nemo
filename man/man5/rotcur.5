.TH ROTCUR 5NEMO "11 May 2021"

.SH "NAME"
rotcur \- parameters for some frequently used galaxies

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

For a few standard galaxies we list their geometric parameters. Programs
such as \fIrotcur(1NEMO)\fP will need these.

.PP
In the table below the center of rotation is listed in decimal RA/DEC,
as well as the VLSR (in km/s), followed by the Inclination and
the kinematic major axis (as defined by the receding side), and the
near minor axis. If the galaxy has a bar, it's position angle
is also listed.
