.SH "DESCRIPTION"
REBOUND is an N-body integrator, i.e. a software package that can
integrate the motion of particles under the influence of gravity. The
particles can represent stars, planets, moons, ring or dust
particles. REBOUND is very flexible and can be customized to
accurately and efficiently solve many problems in astrophysics.

.PP

REBOUND is a library, and tools will need to be written (typically in C) to
create science applications. A python interface is also available.

.PP
NEMO has current 4 example programs that are linked with the REBOUND library:
.nf
.ta +2i

reb2s		convert rebound to NEMO
s2reb		convert NEMO to rebound
reb_integrate	integrate a system and produce a SimulationArchive 
reb_viewer	view a SimulationArchive 
.fi

.SH "INSTALL"

Before NEMO's rebound tools are installed, rebound needs to be
installed within NEMO. A typical install can be:

.EX
         cd $NEMO/usr/hannorein
         make install
         cd nemo
         make install
	 
.EE
The command \fBmknemo -a\fP can also be used to install, since the code
lives in the NEMO/usr tree.
