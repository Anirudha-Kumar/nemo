A few of the smaller input files from https://nbabel.org/input
They vary in size from N=16 to N=16384, in powers of 2


Direct links:  
   http://nbabel.org/files/input/inputFilesSmall.tar.gz    (for N=16..1024)
   http://nbabel.org/files/input/inputFilesBig.tar.gz      (for N=2048..16384)


NOTE: the original input files have an extra blank line in the file.

This means the NEMO command

      tabtos input16 input16.snap block1=skip,mass,pos,vel

will fail.   If you remove the last line, e.g. using

      sed -i '$d' input16

it will work. You can also explicitly use nbody=, and the conversion
will succeed, even though it complains about the short 2nd snapshot

      tabtos input16 input16.snap block1=skip,mass,pos,vel nbody=16
