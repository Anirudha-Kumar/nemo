These files were copied from the cfitsio distribution and are only needed for some hacking.

There is a possibility that there is a version skew, as reported when programs use different header files.
In NEMO we use

#include <cfitsio/fitsio.h>
  vs.
#include <fitsio.h>

for normal usage.

After a "mknemo cfitsio" however, they will exist in $NEMO/opt/include
