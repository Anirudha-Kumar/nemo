glnemo ChangeLog


in CVS (V 0.90, April 2006)

	*) Animation:
	   ----------

	- an animation module has been added (click on Camera Icon, or
	press M). From this module you can record/play an animation
	(Record/Play tab). Once recorded, you can render each frames in
	PNG files. Then you can use mencoder to make a movie.

	*) Octree: 
	   -------
	- an Octree engine has been implemented to locate high density
	area. The octree can be activated from Options Dialog
	Box->Experimental Tab. Note that the octree can be itself
	displayed.
	
	*) features : 
           ----------
	- Alpha channel slide added for particles (CF OpenGL tab in Option
	Dialog box)

	- you can specify communication port
	(with gyrfalcON) from connexion server box

	*) Bugs fixed: 
           -----------
	- in options box, grid's buttons and HUD's buttons have the right
	color selected

	- CTRL+A (best fit) works fine if there is no particles.

	- port command line parameter works now - many others fixed

Version 0.87 (December 2005)
============================

	*) general
	   --------

	- all dialog form boxes are now designed with QT designer tool
	(.ui file) which allow a better development.

	- accept snapshot from standard input '-', it allows stuff like:
	mkplummer - 100000 | glnemo -

	- a lot of options from the command line (see glnemo help=h).
  
	- gaz like particle effect (ALT+G) need a powerfull OpenGL video
	card with an accelerated driver (NVIDIA recommended) and not too
	many particles (lower than 30 000) but the effect is VERY nice.

	- possibility to select particles from a list of indexes read from
	a file (option select_list=). It must be an ascii file with the
	following structure:

#p_index_list <---------- MUST be the first line (header file)
index01
index02
...
...
indexXX

	- option to print the OpenGL frame buffer
	
	- valgrind safe.

	- **A LOT** of bugs fixed and new features.

	- New licence: CeCILL V 2.0
	
	*) enhanced option dialog box 
	   ---------------------------

	- added new option dialog box with tab frame.

	- added option frame to enable/disable particles

	- added option frame to enter rotation/translation/zoom value

	- added option frame to modify grid (length, size and color of
	each planar grid)

	- added option frame to enable/disable gaz like particle rendering
	(ALT + G)

	- added embeded smoke texture - added orthographic projection
