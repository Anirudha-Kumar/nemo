(See also the TODO list in the manual page)

Short term:

  - inline help as the cursor moves over the keyword (can tk do that?)
	or else just click on the keyword to make it say something helpful
  - a QUITCOMMAND and HELPCOMMAND helper
  - read keyword files for persistent execution
    it needs to read/write a keyword file, and to be compatible with
    drpacs, it ought to be a shell-neutral "key=val" text file
  - allow in /bin/csh script to also accept the following type of construct

	set a=1		#> SLIDER 	0,10,0.1

    notice the missing a=1 in that case... is that really wise?

  - if tkrun script is given with no path reference, it might need ./
    else people that have no . in $path will get a cryptic error message
    that it cannot execute the script! or:   set path=($path  .)

  - now that save/load works, the code should warn if it has modified
    parameters after a load or start. to give user an option to save key
    file

Longer term:

  - change the geometry mananger over from 'pack' to 'grid'
 
Check out freshmeat program that was reported back in oct/nov 2000?
seems to do a very similar thing.
