(See also the TODO list in the manual page)

Short term:

  - inline help as the cursor moves over the keyword (can tk do that?)
  - read keyword files for persistent execution
  - allow in /bin/csh script to also accept the following type of construct

	set a=1		#> SLIDER 	0,10,0.1

    notice the missing a=1 in that case... is that really wise?

Longer term:

  - change the geometry mananger over from 'pack' to 'grid'
 
Check out freshmeat program that was reported back in oct/nov 2000?
seems to do a very similar thing.
