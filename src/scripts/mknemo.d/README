Each executable that follows non-standard procedures to be installed,
should have a corresponding shell script in this directory.

Under normal circumstances you should also be able to try out alternative
install methods, e.g.

	 ./gsl git=1

to install the git based version of GSL, instead of the standard one pointed
to by the version= keyword in the nemo.d/gsl script
