# This file is a template for the NEMORC.local file, which should be
# in your $NEMO root directory. Copy this file as 'NEMORC.local' and
# make appropriate changes to the variables from the NEMORC file itself
# that you want to have modified, and set variables like NEMOSITE
# and YAPPLIB. Never edit this file as NEMORC.gen, as you will most likely
# loose any changes in future updates.

#  Each site should really have an identification name in 'NEMOSITE';
#  could be as complicated as to include machine name via `hostname`,
#  version numbers etc. But could also be a fixed name for your site.
#  Your choice, it is merely used as an identifcation in some programs
#  when data is generated/exported (e.g. in FITS)

setenv NEMOSITE `hostname`


#  Set your default YAPPLIB, the current YAPP_NULL will do nothing.
#  most likely you want to make it $YAPP_PGPLOT or so, but in most of
#  those cases you will need to tailor various path elements.

#  Here's your default YAPP library
#setenv YAPPLIB     "$NEMOLIB/yapp_@YAPP_NAME@.o @YAPP_LIBS@"
setenv YAPP        @YAPP_DEF@

#  If you use the VoGL library for xyzview, this is the only reasonable default
setenv VDEVICE X11

#  tabpp needs this
#setenv $PP_DIR  /somewhere/pp_dir


#  Particularly if you use shared libraries (e.g. pgplot in $NEMOLIB) you
#  may need to change LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
#  Change 0 -> 1 if you need this
