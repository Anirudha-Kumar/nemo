Here we gather some simple examples of parsing a command line user interface.
We have choosen the variables 'aaa' and 'bbb' in their long form. Where the CLI
supports this, short options 'a' and 'b' are implemented, though NEMO's
getparam() does not support this.


#                                bash     csh  python
0   simplest, but bad form          x       x
1   manual                                         
2   argparse                                        x
3   docopt                                          x
4   getopts                         ?       ?
5   clic                                            x
