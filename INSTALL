The detailed installation instructions are in the file README.install.
The script  docs/test_a_new_nemo_git contains a  fully worked out
example how to install NEMO.

Basically, the install is a sequence is that most autoconf based software
uses:

	./configure
	make install

however, make install does not actuall install the software,
but merely prints out the instructions what to do.
