- compiling on some older linux versions will fail due to a prototype
  for dprintf() in /usr/include/stdio.h - you can comment out our
  version in $NEMOINC/stdinc.h and it will work.

  still a linking problem on those cases left... (redhat 5.2)

- mktemp() should be converted mkstemp() in stropen.c (SuSe compiler
  will complain about it, but it will work).
  Problem: can't get a fileno from a FILE * (the other way around
  is ok, use fileno()) so we're stuck....

* src/kernel/misc/fie.c   does not compile with "-g -O" (I/O error in compiler)
  on gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Linux-Mandrake 8.0 2.96-0.48mdk)
  -g or just -O is ok.
  --- ah --- maybe it was just a quota problem :=)

- nbody0: some weird problems on Mandrake 8.0 with 'nan's...
  gcc 2.96 20000731 (Linux-Mandrake 8.0 2.96-0.48mdk) 

- solaris: still get -rdynamic in the link options, it works, but it
  does not look nice. this is for gcc, didn't try /opt/SUNSWpro

- Suse didn't resolve fortran binding to C too well for potentials
  (.so object files, e.g. athan92)
