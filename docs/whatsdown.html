<H1> What's Down in NEMO </H1>

Here we intend to list software decided not to be supported
anymore, or that under consideration.

<HR>

<H2> Discontinued support for </H2>
<UL>
<LI> suntools, since Solaris 2.x has dropped it.
<LI> old-style makefiles; we plan to allow includes, and possibly
	full 'gnu-makefile'
<LI> non-ANSI (old tyle K&R) compilers, there is now code that is
     purely ANSI prototyped. The program 
     <A HREF=man/catl/unproto.l> unproto </A> needs to be compiled
     and installed as a <I> cpp </I> replacement if you really have
     a compiler that cannot handle ansi C code. There may be compilers
     around which do not allow a cpp replacement.  <br>
     As of NEMO 4.2 we are using C99.
<LI> (nov-94) With the upcoming V3 of the command line user interface
     <A HREF=man_html/getparam.3.html> getparam(3NEMO) </A>
     the following features  will not be available anymore:
    <UL>
    <LI> The host= system keyword, but we are thinking of using
        sockets
    <LI> DMM menu interface. If compiled, it was available under
        help=8.
    <LI> No more UsageLog, this kept a list in $NEMO/adm/Usage. Was
        normally not compiled anymore, but now supporting code has
        been removed.
    </UL>

</UL>

<H2> Considering dropping support for  </H2>
<UL> 
<LI> old style images which do not carry a reference pixel (default: 0).
  the fits equivalent is the CRPIXn keyword.   As of version 4.2 the
  conversion to using CRPIX (called <B>Xrefpix</B> etc.)
</UL>
