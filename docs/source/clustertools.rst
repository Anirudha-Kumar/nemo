ClusterTools
------------


This python package can also read NEMO (gyrfalcON) files. Installation can be done
as follows:

.. code-block::

      cd $NEMO/local
      git clone https://github.com/webbjj/clustertools
      pip install -e clustertools


For a few packages, we have a few existing examples in the ``$NEMO/usr`` tree
(e.g. amuse, martini, unsio and uns_projects)
