=============

Here we attempt to summarize some common  codes used in stellar dynamics, superseding
the terribly out of date list that the NEMO website was using. We only tend to list
codes that are (publically) available.   I've not put SPH/hydro codes in this list.
See also `ASCL <https://ascl.net>`_.

.. todo::   the CODES glossary needs to be annotated and spiced up with links
