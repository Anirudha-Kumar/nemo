This is the sphinx tree for NEMO documentation, meant to replace the old latex manual.
You will need an account on https://readthedocs.org/ and set up automatic building
from the NEMO github repo.

Developers will need more modules in their python environment, e.g.

   pip install -r $NEMO/docs/requirements.txt

Here are a few workflow ideas:
   

to test html tree:
   make html
   open _build/html/index.html
 or:
   (cd build_/html; python3 -m http.server)
   # open browser on:   http://0.0.0.0:8000/

to test single html:
   make singlehtml
   open _build/singlehtml/index.html

to test pdf:
   make latexpdf
   open _build/latex/nemo.pdf

to test man:
   make man
   man -l _build/man/nemo.1

Errors:

1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
