ZENO and NEMO
=============


`ZENO <http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/barnes/zeno/index.html>`_
is Josh Barnes' version of an earlier version of NEMO that he
continues to develop.
We also keep a
`zeno manual page <https://teuben.github.io/nemo/man_html/zeno.1.html>`_
highlighting some differences.
