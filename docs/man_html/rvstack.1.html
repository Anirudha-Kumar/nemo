<b>rvstack</b>
takes all points within a (narrow) wedge around the major or minor axis
of an assumed galaxy disk data cube, and construct a Radius-Velocity diagram,
centered on the galaxy in position and velocity.  It will stack the two
sides of the galaxy (but see also <b>side=</b>), so the radial coordinate will
run from 0 to some Rmax.  In velocity it will run from some Vmin to some
Vmax, but always expecting positive rotation and positive outflow, assuming
the position angle is correctly set.  <p>
Weak signal rotation and/or bulk outflow
could be detected this way, but we offer no guarentee. If you have many
like-minded galaxies, stacking these images may beat the noise down much
more. <p>
Options exist to scale the Radius and Velocity to different units,
such that many galaxies can be stacked in physical space, as opposed to
angular space. See <b>rscale=</b> and <b>vscale=</b>. <p>
When <b>gscale=t</b> is set, the coordinates
are scaled as follows: <br>
<pre>Rotation<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;Outflow
--------<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;-------
R<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;R/cos(i)
V/sin(i)<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;V/cos(i)
this will likely leave some gaps in radius and velocity. See discussion
below.

You can also select to only construct the signal from one side of the galaxy.
See side= below.

Points along an arc are all accumulated (technically: averaged), and placed
on the same radial grid
as the pixel size in the input data cube. We might need some trick next
neighbor smoothing
in order for pixels near the center to have a value.

Parameters The following parameters are recognized in order; they may be
given in any order if the keyword is also given. Use --help to confirm this
man page is up to date.  in=image_cube input data cube, in standard image(5NEMO)
format. [No default] out=image_map output R-V map. [No default] pa= position
angle along which the wedge is taken. This is normally  the receding side
(with mode=rotation) or the minor axis near side (for mode=outflow), in
order get a positive velocity signal in the RV map. Only when gscale=t is
set, will there be a difference how the radius and velocity are scaled.
inc= inclination angle of the disk [45] vsys= systemic velocity [0]   
center=xpos,ypos rotation center (0,0=lower left). If not supplied, the
reference pixel will be used. Default: reference pixel. angle= angle around
major or minor axis around which points are accumulated into the R-V plot.
[Default: 10] blank= Value of the blank pixel to be ignored. Not yet used.
rscale= Scaling factor for radius. This would be used to stack galaxies
based on a KPC scaling, or an Re scaling, not geometry, see gscale= below.
 [Default: 1] vscale= Scaling factor for velocity. This would be  used to
stack galaxies based on a mass scaling, not geometry, see gscale= below.
[Default: 1] gscale=f|t Scale for inclination based geometry. Rotation is
scaled by 1/sin(i), outflow by 1/cos(i). Radius is not scaled for rotation,
but by 1/cos(i) for outflow.   [Default: f] mode=r|o Select output mode:
rotation (r) or outflow (o).   For rotation, points around pa= are selected,
for outflow, points around pan=. [Default: r] side=0|-1|1 By default it will
stack both sides, but this option will allow you to stack one or the other
side. [Default: 0]  CaveatsNo geometric correction is made based on the
angle in the disk. This could become a future option A wedge has the disadvantage
the the noise decreases inversely proportional to the sqrt(radius) 
The
gaps in radius and/or velocity produced with gscale=t can be a nuisance.
For stacking many images, this should disappear, but otherwise some smoothing/interpolation
might be needed. Not implemented.  
ExamplesAn example using our standard
NGC 6503 cube given in km/s velocity units.  
  rvstack ngc6503.ccd rvma.ccd pa=-60 inc=75 vsys=27 center=164,123 rscale=3600

  rvstack ngc6503.ccd rvmi.ccd pa=30  inc=75 vsys=27 center=164,123 rscale=3600
