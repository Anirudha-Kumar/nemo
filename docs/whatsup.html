<H1> What's Up in NEMO </H1>

Ideas.....and things we're working on. The list below is really old, though some items have
never gone away, so we're leaving them.
<BR>
We are now maintaining a more active
list on <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/projects>GitHub Projects</A>,
and for other items see also the
<A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/issues>Github Issues</A>.


<HR>

<H2> Currently working on </H2>
<UL>
  <LI> python support
  <LI> omp support (-fopenmp): --enable [but not much code uses it actively]
  <LI> switch the default matrix definition from C based to Fortran based, to better match
    FITS I/O. There is a branch MATDEF (from CVS times) where this is developed.
<LI> moving from MAKE to CMAKE?   [jcl]  
<LI> code conversions:
  <UL>
  <LI> proper  prototype usage to aid compilation with -DSINGLEPREC and
 	using the g++ compiler instead of gcc compiler 
  <LI> Random I/O:
  <LI> Adding some new integrators: Sellwood's GALAXY, Aarseth's
	NBODY1 and NBODY2.
  <LI> although all -DSINGLEPREC is now supposed to work, some minor
      cleanup may be needed, in particular the proc's. Perhaps
      use new typedef's for prototyped versions. Sometimes one can
      get by with only a helper typedef in the actual code where
      the (*proc)() is called. [see e.g. contour.c]
  </UL>
<LI> Planned upgrades:
    <UL>
    <LI> automatic selection of yapp's during installation [done]
    <LI> default hdf support 
    <LI> add cmhog/hdfgrid support
    <LI> add some more potentials, e.g. athan92, piner94
    <LI> tcl/tk support for genscript's
    <LI> better mapsys support
    <LI> Sellwood's N-body integrator [done, but now there is galaxy15]
    <LI> add NEMOXLIB, NEMOXINC environment variables for X windows
    <LI> starlab support
    <LI> velfit support needs to include diskfit now
    </UL>
<LI> supplying <B> all </B> manual pages for the kernel routines
<LI> orbname, orbwood - orbit classification and spectral dynamics (code is actually lost)
<LI> snapfit - best fit 6D snapshot to a 3D data cube
<LI> yapp_x - generic X windows device  (Patrick Frisch' contribution)
<LI> snap interface (Luis Aguilar)
<LI> serial snapshot processing. This is primarely usefull for 'small'
    memory (slow?) machines where as snapshot is broken up in pieces
    (see e.g. <A HREF=man_html/snapsplit.3.html> snapsplit </A> or 
    <A HREF=man_html/mkspiral.1.html>mkspiral</A>) 
    and processed independantly. Useful
    for Monte-Carlo simulations.
</UL>

<H2> Considering work on  </H2>
<UL> 
<LI> yapp_generic - binds multiple yapp's into one (cf. yapp_pgplot),
	in particular for yapp_x and yapp_ps
<LI> tk interface ala Khoros/Cantata and Mirtool [abandoned]
<LI> better image data-structure, e.g. allowing dynamic typing, and 
	better random access for big images/cubes.
<LI> support for non-homogenous snapshots (e.g. SPH, Tipsy "3S")
<LI> stripping kernel routines in favor of a more generic library, such
	as glib (part of <A HREF=http://www.gtk.org/>GTK+</A>).
</UL>
