Notes on the table V2 design
============================

Development:  summer 2020, and spring 2022 - see the table2 branch

API:
----

The API is defined in table.3
    man 3 table
and some comments on interfaces with other ascii table systems in table.5
    man 5 table

As usual, implemention in
   $NEMO/inc/table.h
   $NEMO/src/kernel/tab/table.c

The legacy interface get_atable() is the one most likely to remain implemented,
since it's used in so many codes. It requires the user to know the number of lines
in the file though, which is what we wanted to move away from...
(there's a script $NEMO/src/scripts/wsl that can quickly find those)

TODO
----
- recognize comments, and place them in their table structure
- free memory that was allocated (use valgrind)


Testing methods:
----------------

Some initial testing was done in
   $NEMO/src/kernel/tab/tabbench1.c
   $NEMO/src/kernel/tab/tabbench2.c
but in the usual NEMO sense, table.c has a TESTBED to make tabletest:

    make tabletest
    ./tabletest ....
    
    mknemo tabbench2
    tabbench2 ...

The following programs were converted, and some comments on their conversion:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    meanmed        super easy, since it was line by line processing.
    tabcomment     simple, since it's processing line by line; no maxpnt= or so
    tabstat    	   was using get_atable, not table_md2cr() - more complex manual labor
    funtab         get_atable -> table_md2cr; kept #ifdef
    tabmath        manual
    tabstat        get_atable -> table_md2cr
    tabint         get_atable -> table_md2cr; kept #ifdef
    tabtranspose   no more burststring()
    tabcols        reads line by line

The most common pattern get_atable()   ->   table_md2cr()

    # select the columns you want, but you get all rows (up to nmax)
    # in columns pointed to by coldat[icol]
    nrows = get_atable(instr,ncols,colnr,coldat,nmax);

    # select the columns and rows you want, though generally nrows=0, meaning get all
    d2 = table_md2cr(tptr,ncols,colnr,nrows, rownr)
    coldat[icol] = &d1[icol][0]
