Adapted from Jin Koda's Version 1.7 of etude
  (which is an SPH adaptation of Josh Barnes' new treecode, as can
   be found in $NEMO/src/nbody/evolve/hackcode/treecode1)

- needed to add some USE_NEMO_IO

- only works in PRECISION = DOUBLEPREC
  (or do the same trick as in treecode1 with sqe() etc.)

- small typo forgotten ';'  in THREEDIM section in *iknl +=  in treesph.c


- only smoothing length is written out, with mass, that gives density.
  The gas is assumed isothermal, at 10,000 K.
