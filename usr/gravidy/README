As for install, the 'cpu' version is the easiest to install, although
also the slowest.  It just needs the BOOST library, which in Ubuntu
is a simple
     sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev


Example install from scratch: (version may be newer)

   wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.69.0/source/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz
   tar zxf boost_1_69_0.tar.gz
   cd boost_1_69_0
   ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$NEMO/opt
   ./b2
