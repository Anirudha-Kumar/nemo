current version
---------------
- huge speed up on the rendering engine (500% !), thanks to :
   - vertex buffer object
   - vertex and pixel shader
   - GL_POINT_SPRITE_ARB and GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE_NV

- offscreen rendering, using frame buffer object, to take screenshot from the command line and from the GUI

- many bugs fixed
