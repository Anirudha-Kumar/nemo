Differences from Dehnen's distribution:


1) some files needed to be renamed because  MacOSX cannot
   see upper and lower case differently


utils/inc/Math.h      	renamed to WDMath.h
utils/src/Math.cc     	now includes WDMath.h

src/acc/combined.cc	renamed to combined_a.cc
src/acc/Combined.cc	no change,  but this was duplicated on MacOSX


2) when you build within nemo,use the -i flag to pass over problems,
   and make sure CXX=$CXX is compatible with the one in $NEMOLIB/makedefs
