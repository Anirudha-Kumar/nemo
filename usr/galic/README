Compiling the code:

Of course you should read the GalIC/README file, but here is some Ubuntu
notes how to do this within NEMO. Adapt where needed.


1) You will need MPI installed

      apt install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev

   If you install mpich instead, this may have an impact on 4) below
      
2) You will need gsl installed

      apt install libgsl-dev

   or internally to NEMO:

      mknemo gsl
      
3) create two system files for compiling:

- cp Template-Makefile.systype Makefile.systype
  edit it to comment out the line containing
      #SYSTYPE="Ubuntu"

- cp Template-Config.sh Config.sh
  edit it to ensure the HDF5 is commented out
      #HAVE_HDF5 

4) Edit their GalIC/Makefile , i needed this for my openmpi
   

#MPICHLIB = -lmpich
MPICHLIB =


5) Now make it:

    make CC=mpicc
    cp GalIC $NEMOBIN

   I also copied the GalIC executable to $NEMOBIN



Running the code and a benchmark
--------------------------------


time mpirun -np 4 GalIC Model_B1.param
took 151m (605m  user, 29s sys)

Only B1,B2,H1,H2,H3,H4 seem to work. The rest crashes.
GalIC  Model_M1.param

Not enough memory in mymalloc_fullinfo() to allocate 19940.4 MB for variable 'P'
