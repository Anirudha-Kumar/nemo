1) REBOUND:  https://github.com/hannorein/rebound

To get it:
   git clone http://github.com/hannorein/rebound 
or
   wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/hannorein/rebound/tarball/master -O- | tar xvz

then

   cd rebound/examples/shearing_sheet
   make
   ./nbody


the compilation could fail if some libraries GL/glut.h cannot be found. In that case
grab that library from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ or use your package manager
to install it.  E.g on ubuntu 10.10 you will need freeglut3-dev, ie.
    dpkg -i freeglut3-dev

on ubuntu20:  sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev

for sphinx i needed:  sudo apt-get install breathe-doc
or for your python:   pip install breathe

2) simplest:    this is an example of the similarly named problem in rebound/examples/simplest,
   but now with an example Makefile that can compile your problem outside of the rebound
   source tree.
   Deprecated because the Makefile does not work anymore, use selfgravity_plummer, since it is
   a new implementation.

3) selfgravity_plummer: NEMO-fied version of rebound/examples/selfgravity_plummer
   Implemented in the 4.0.3 version of rebound

4) The 2024 work with rebound 4.0 - we need the following tools for a better NEMO integration:
   - snapshot to rebound
   - rebound to snapshot
   - visualize
   - integrator
