This is the NEMOfied rebound/examples/selfgravity_plummer/problem.c
A total hack, as proof of concept how Rebound can be driven by a NEMO tool.

Done:
- Hacked the Makefile, works on Linux and Mac, but unlikely on Windows
  Note this Makefile does not update the librebound, that needs to
  be done with the top level "make install" in $NEMO/usr/hannorein
  
- added some command line parameters

ToDo:
- read in a NEMO snapshot
