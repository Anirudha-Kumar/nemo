EPIC5 (written in Fortran, it uses PGPLOT routines)

- To compile:
     make epic5 install
  and consult the Makefile if the variables are correct. Notably the LIBS=-lpgplot
  could need to be different in your environment.


- See the unix manual page ("man epic5" in NEMO) for some help
  how to run.   

  The example in the man page is interactive, but
  can be reproduced too-quick-to-see using
     epic5 < epic5.stdin
