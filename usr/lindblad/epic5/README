EPIC5 (written in Fortran, it uses PGPLOT routines)

- To compile the code you need to type once ./cepic5_fin
- After doing this once, just run it typing ./epic5_fin
- If needed, the relevant PGPLOT routines may be included in the compiled program by:
 
 gfortran -o epic5_fin EPIC5_fin.f /usr/lib/libpgplot.a /usr/lib/libpng.a -lX11
