Remaining MacOSX problems: (a special macosx.html web page dedicated to this)
  - configure leaves -lcrt.o etc. in, so they need manual removal
    from makedefs and NEMORC.gen before continuing on

  - src/nbody/evolve/aarseth/nbody0/Makefile
	need to activate F77LIBS to include -lcc_dynamic

  - directcode doesn't compile since it was derived from an earlier
    release of hackcode1 with the multiple externs included by the
    linker

  - xyzview is too slow to be useful, we should recode it such that
    OpenGL (and thus Mesa) can be linked. This would also remove the
    immediate need for vogl.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

general things for 3.2.x
  - make sure cfitsio stuff is ok in configure
  - the change in get_atable() should mean routines need to work
    on buffered table read better
  - ccdmath WCS is broken
  - fix installation if no fortran is available
	(fmath in potential not needed)
	(some potential/data not needed)
  - intel linker problems (use different technique to force loading?)
  - get a mini-NEMO going (Dehnen, BIMA/CARMA)
  - remove environment variables from NEMORC.local that are needed in Makefiles
    and move them into makedefs
	**mostly done**

  => a NEMO install for gyrfalcON, so we don't have to figure the funky NEMOHOST
     in Walter's tree  (he is using make's MACHTYPE and OSTYPE internal variables)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

some other help on configure:
	http://www.airs.com/ian/configure/

- io_nemo library written by JCL in Marseille
	has problems in -DSINGLEPREC

- add the self-exploding problem for treecodes (Salmon ...)
  into NEMODAT

- clean code so it can write > 2GB datafiles		[mostly done]
  Testing can be done with:
	mkspiral s000 1000000 nmodel=40
  which creates a file just over the famous 2GB limits
  testing reading
	tsf s000

- install on solaris is broken:				[fixed w/ gcc, cc/f77 minor patch needed]

	- FORLIBS needs the 
	  -R /opt/SUNWspro/lib -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lF77 -lM77 -lV77 -lsunmath 
	  type solution for pgplot, and if so,
	- FORLIBS need to be added to YAPPLIB

	- sun's make doesn't work, it need gmake

- compile under cygwin

- fix for pgplot  when libpng is needed, or tcl/tk for that matter....

- if the code has to be C++ friendly, i.e. the nemo_main() be compiled
  by c++, but the rest with CC,  all extern's must be wrapped in


  #if defined(__cplusplus)
  extern "C" {
  #endif
  ...
  #if defined(__cplusplus)
  }
  #endif

- getparam:  an option to produce an iraf .par file?

- many integrators use conflicting designations for tstop,freq,freqout

- getparam:  finish the outkeys= stuff

- fortran-to-C
   some fortran compilers need -nofor_main to prevent main getting
   linked in from the fortran library
   
   some linkers want to link with gcc, not g77 or vice versa? This
   may require a configure macro in the makefiles

- problems in -DSINGLEPREC mode:

	- nemo_io
	- rotcur/rotcurshape: cube1/cube1.sig appears to create some NaN pixels
	- mkommod has problems with out of bounds intervals
