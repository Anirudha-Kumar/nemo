some other help on configure:

- io_nemo library written by JCL in Marseille


- add the self-exploding problem for treecodes (Salmon ...)
  into NEMODAT

- clean code so it can write > 2GB datafiles
  Testing can be done with:
	mkspiral s000 1000000 nmodel=40
  which creates a file just over the famous 2GB limits
  testing reading
	tsf s000

- install on solaris is broken:

	- FORLIBS needs the 
	  -R /opt/SUNWspro/lib -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lF77 -lM77 -lV77 -lsunmath 
	  type solution for pgplot, and if so,
	- FORLIBS need to be added to YAPPLIB
