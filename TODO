Remaining MacOSX problems: (a special macosx.html web page dedicated to this)
  - configure leaves -lcrt.o etc. in, so they need manual removal
    from makedefs and NEMORC.gen before continuing on

  - src/nbody/evolve/aarseth/nbody0/Makefile
	need to activate F77LIBS to include -lcc_dynamic

  - directcode doesn't compile since it was derived from an earlier
    release of hackcode1 with the multiple externs included by the
    linker

  - xyzview is too slow to be useful, we should recode it such that
    OpenGL (and thus Mesa) can be linked. This would also remove the
    immediate need for vogl.
    (try JCL's new program 'glnemo')

problems with gcc4: (as tested on FC3)
  - pgplot: grfont.dat cannot be built, some runtime problem with fortran
  - pgplot: needs a gfortran_gcc4.conf file for now
	also:  no more -fno-backslash
	also:  %VAL() does not seem to be supported anymore ???
	also:  some formatted reading that spans multi lines BAD (pgpack.f)
  - no more -fno-globals for fortran
  - no more -fwritable-strings in C
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

general things for 3.2.x
  - make sure cfitsio stuff is ok in configure (THIS IS BROKEN NOW)
  - the change in get_atable() should mean routines need to work
    on buffered table read better
  - ccdmath WCS is broken
  - fix installation if no fortran is available
	(fmath in potential not needed)
	(some potential/data not needed)
  - intel linker problems (use different technique to force loading?)
  - get a mini-NEMO going (Dehnen, BIMA/CARMA)
  * remove environment variables from NEMORC.local that are needed in Makefiles
    and move them into makedefs
  - use some kind of global MAXBODY where we often use different values
	**mostly done**

  => a NEMO install for gyrfalcON, so we don't have to figure the funky NEMOHOST
     in Walter's tree  (he is using make's MACHTYPE and OSTYPE internal variables)
    gyrfalcON:
        3.2.2 compiles ok on linux
	3.2.3 ok
	3.3.1 ok
	3.3.2 ok
	3.3.4 fails
        3.3.4 breaks eventually   [macosX also dies here]
        3.4.2 dies very quickly (fc3)
	3.4.3 
    

things for 3.4

  - -fwritable-strings is deprecated, from NEMO 3.2.3 this is taken out
  + linking with unused functions (e.g. to aid loadobj) can now cause
    failure. we've repaired/kludged most, but the flag
		-fno-unit-at-a-time
    is claimed to maybe work 'for some time'

some other help on configure:
	http://www.airs.com/ian/configure/
	
code & line coverage: (gcov, lcov)
  http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php
  

- io_nemo library written by JCL in Marseille
	has problems in -DSINGLEPREC

- add the self-exploding problem for treecodes (Salmon ...)
  into NEMODAT

- clean code so it can write > 2GB datafiles		[mostly done]
  Testing can be done with:
	mkspiral s000 1000000 nmodel=40
  which creates a file just over the famous 2GB limits
  testing reading
	tsf s000

- gyrfalcON uses potentials in such a way that only potential_float
  is looked for ???

- install on solaris is broken:				[fixed w/ gcc, cc/f77 minor patch needed]

	- FORLIBS needs the 
	  -R /opt/SUNWspro/lib -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lF77 -lM77 -lV77 -lsunmath 
	  type solution for pgplot, and if so,
	- FORLIBS need to be added to YAPPLIB

	- sun's make doesn't work, it need gmake

- compile under cygwin

- fix for pgplot  when libpng is needed, or tcl/tk for that matter....

- if the code has to be C++ friendly, i.e. the nemo_main() be compiled
  by c++, but the rest with CC,  all extern's must be wrapped in


  #if defined(__cplusplus)
  extern "C" {
  #endif
  ...
  #if defined(__cplusplus)
  }
  #endif

- getparam:  an option to produce an iraf .par file?

- many integrators use conflicting designations for tstop,freq,freqout

- getparam:  finish the outkeys= stuff

- overal design:
  separation of funtionality and data format. E.g. to compute the 
  statistics of a variable in either a table, a snapshot or an image
  should have the same set of keywords that control the statistics.
  Yet accessing the data is different. This is done rather sloppy
  and slightly different in different places.

- fortran-to-C
   some fortran compilers need -nofor_main to prevent main getting
   linked in from the fortran library
   
   some linkers want to link with gcc, not g77 or vice versa? This
   may require a configure macro in the makefiles

- problems in -DSINGLEPREC mode:

	- nemo_io
	- rotcur/rotcurshape: cube1/cube1.sig appears to create some NaN pixels
	- mkommod has problems with out of bounds intervals

- configure should use more consistent use of the
	--with-xxx-yyy=DIR
  where xxx is any of e.g. x11,tk,tcl,,.... libaries
  and yyy is either dir    if it specifies -I DIR/ionclude -L DIR/lib
	        include    if it specifies -I DIR
		    lib    if it specifies -L DIR
