NEMO is a toolbox for stellar dynamics, particle simulations, image processing and
tabular data manipulation.

This is the 4th major release of NEMO,  and although data are compatible
with earlier releases, source code will generally need to be tweaked a
bit to compile and link in the newer releases. 

NEMO V1:	IAS release (Barnes, Hut & Teuben; appr. 1987)
NEMO V2:	UMD release (Teuben 1994)
NEMO V3:	UMD release (Teuben 2001) with autoconf support and
		hooks into manybody.org modules starlab and partiview
NEMO V4:        UMD release (2017) now maintained within github

A related package, ZENO, was spun off NEMO V1, and is maintained by Barnes.
